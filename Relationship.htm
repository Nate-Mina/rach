<font size="5">This Page is devoted to the Secret relationship between one 
Rachael Louise Slack(patton) and Nathaniel Mina</font></b></span></span></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">To sum up the relationship between Rachael and Nate (myself) 
I'll start at the beginning, I met her on her 20th birthday Dec 31. 2010. at a 
nightclub in the city of Rochester where a friend of mine and hers told me I 
should dance with her as she was interested in me. so I approached her and we 
started dancing and having a good time and I took a picture</font></p>
<p align="center">
<font size="4">
<img border="0" src="pics/insertpics/birthday.jpg" width="256" height="197"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">Later I asked if she wanted the pic and she said she did and 
gave me her number. We then left the club and I drove her to her friends house 
who was having an after party. when we got there she passed out as she was very 
drunk. the next morning, Jan 1, we wanted to meet up but I had a flight out to 
Florida the next morning for work in the Bahamas on cruise ships so we did not 
have the chance to meet that day. While I was gone for 6 weeks we texted each 
other everyday&nbsp; and i would call her and we learned a lot about each other, 
later I asked her out for valentines day and she said she couldn't wait so I 
began planning for it and counting the days before I would return home. Turns 
out I returned home the night of Feb 13 and then slept and was excited to see 
Rachael after I had been talking to her for 6 weeks prior. the morning of 
valentines day I stopped and got flowers and prepared for it all.. when got home 
I called her and she said that she was kinda talking to some other guy (John 
Patton) but that it didn't matter and she still wanted to see me.. I was kinda 
disappointed but she said she was just talking to him and not in a relationship 
so I was ok with it. I picked her up from her house and meet her friend Maria 
for the first time. we went on a nice date and came back to my place where we 
experimented with zip ties and we kinda got stuck together and fell over on my 
bed which is where hour first kiss took place. The next day I picked her up and 
we had a blast and then came back to my place and had sex for the first time as 
well. the day after that was Wednesday, Feb 16 where we spent the afternoon 
together and then she introduced me to her older friends Julie and louis and we 
cuddled on there couch and watch SVU which Rachael loves</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">We then left and went to a dunkin doughnuts as shown above. 
The next day was the 17th of Feb and i was forced to leave again for 6 weeks to 
the Bahamas.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">During the time in the Bahamas I would call Rachael almost 
every night and we would have long talks and conversations and then I find out 
she got engaged, i was totally hurt by this and talked with her about it and she 
said she needed to talk with me about it and so we did and she said she may have 
made the wrong decision about getting engaged and she was very unsure about 
things, I talked with her a lot about it and she said she really likes me and we 
both just couldn't wait for me to get back to NY to see each other. After 6 
weeks of talking with her more i grew even more attached to Rachael and though 
she was amazing and perfect for me and she told me I am perfect as well for her. 
I still felt weird about her being engaged but she told me she would figure it 
out and break off the engagement. my sister and i then flew into Florida and 
finished up our work and the drove to NY from Florida. once back we met up with 
Rachael at Eastview mall. and then had dinner with her and my dad.. Later that 
week we went Scuba Diving (<a href="pics/scuba/index.htm">Click here for Album</a>).</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">After staying for around 10 days I had to go back to work out 
in Spain and France and every night i would walk to where the ship phones were 
and I would call Rachael for like over an hour even though it was very 
expensive, (like 30bucks for an hour) then when got back we were all over each 
other again and I had a blast and then we went to my friends out in Niagara 
falls the 5th of may and we went to a strip club and i bough my friends a 
lap dance. Rachael and I began to drink and then we went back to the hotel and we 
got in the hot tub and then everyone came back and while we were going at it 
naked on one of the beds but everyone was so drunk it really didn't matter, one 
of my friends came up to me and was like holy shit, its a live porno in the 
hotel.. Lets just say I wont be forgetting that any time soon. </font> </p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Rachael's Trip for Johns Army Graduation</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">Rachael told me that she would be leaving to go see John 
graduate and I told her that he would most likely convince her to do get 
married, since he had already gotten her engaged and he would be leaving for 
Germany the next week it just made sense that he would try to force her to do 
so.. I told her this and she looked at me crazy and said &quot;Nate, do you think I 
would just get married like that? I love you, if I ever were to get married to 
anyone I would make sure my whole family is there&quot;. so I asked her &quot;so you 
promise you wont and it wont change things with us?&quot; and she promised me she 
wouldn't..</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">&nbsp;She told me to go have fun and meet girls and party 
while she was gone, which I thought was weird and had no interest in meeting new 
girls. That next week was hard because in the beginning I would get a lot of 
phone calls from her and we would talk about everything but then john began to 
suspect that there was more going on between her and I than just friendship. As 
that happened he took more of her time and I was able to talk to her less which 
made me think something was wrong, once while I was talking to her on the phone 
he came over and said through the phone &quot;Go die Nate!&quot; and hung up, later I 
received a phone call from John himself apologizing for saying that. I thought 
that to be really strange and then realized that Rachael must have forced him to 
call me and say sorry.. while she was gone I hung out with my friend Lonna more 
who I like to talk to about relationships and stuff as she shares the same views 
about dating and things. so we went out and partied a bit with my friend Mary 
who took much interest in me.Once she returned, I saw one of her luggage tags 
with her last name as Patton, which is his last name, I asked her about it and 
she said he just wrote that on there and not to worry. The night she returned I 
asked her if she wanted to go to the club with my friend marry and Lonna and 
some other friends and she said she could but then later said she was too tired 
to go :(.. while I was in line to get into the club in Rochester, Rachael called 
me and she was very upset saying that it feels like I've replaced her with marry 
and that she didn't mean anything to me, which was completely&nbsp; the opposite 
as the whole time I was there I was thinking about her and whishing she was with 
me. I came over to her house the next morning and she was acting very strange 
and I guess that there was something that she was not telling me, so I asked her 
the question again. &quot;DID YOU GET MARRIED?&quot;. and she replied to me &quot;what do you 
mean by that?&quot; and said &quot;what don't I mean by that its a simple question!&quot; and 
she said &quot; Legally I got married&quot; and begin crying a lot and I began crying as 
well because she had promised she wouldn't and I knew by the look on her face 
that it was a mistake. A part of me wanted to run outta the house right then 
because I was so mad at me but another part was just hurt and wanted to know why 
she would do this after her and I had spent so much time together and had been 
talking everyday for almost 6 months. I stayed at her house then we drive to 
mount hope cemetery where we walked around and both were really upset and sad. 
she told me she might be forced to stay with him because of the fact that her 
family hates divorce as they are catholic. I was hurt and did not know what to 
think but she comforted me and kissed me and said not to cry. We continued to 
see each other and she continued to lie to john about seeing me.</font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="5">The Fight Between Rachael and I</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">We continued to see each other. Then around the 27-29th of may 
we had been house-sitting again for her friend Judy where she watches the 
animals and cleans. I had heard the night before that John had told her, YOU 
better not have Nate over at the house. and she assured him, while she was right 
next to me that I wasn't over, even though I had been spending my nights with 
her there in bed. Saturday night of the 28th of may we went to a party in the 
back yard of Maria's house where I hung out with Rachael and Maria and Elise and 
her boyfriend James. It was rather uneventful and we made smores and then the 
girls went out for slurpees. and left me and James by the fire where I talked 
with James about the situation with Rachael getting married and lying to me and 
I told him I wasn't sure if she had just been leading me on this whole time or 
not. and he just shook his head and said it was all really messed up.. they got 
back and she had gotten me a slurpee too. she then sent me a picture of herself 
in a bikini.</font></p>
<p align="center">
<font size="4">
<img border="0" src="pics/insertpics/bikini1.jpg" width="171" height="220"><img border="0" src="pics/insertpics/bikini2.jpg" width="170" height="221"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">We then left Maria's house and it began raining really bad to 
the point where we could not see in front of us. we went back to Judy's and 
slept there together. When we woke up that Sunday morning and I received a 
picture message through my phone, which happened to be of her husband john half 
naked. It was to my email too which I get through my Smartphone. I figured he 
must be mad at me and sending a picture to make fun of me? I didn't know but I 
was fairly upset about the whole things so I sent him one of me shirtless. I 
realize shortly after that he did not mean to send me a pic and he had just 
replied to all from the pic she sent both of us and so it sent it to me as well. 
Shortly after he calls her and asks if I am there, she tells him no but then I 
interject and he hears me there.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">&nbsp;He gets really upset and then I receive a
<a href="emailsfromjohn.htm">lengthy email from him</a> that completely sounded 
like she had been lying to him, as she told him that I was begging her for a 
bikini photo, when in truth she had just sent me one.. You can read it yourself 
but basically he told me to stay away from His New property meaning his wife and 
to &quot;stop stalking her&quot; which was a complete lie because that is the furthest 
thing from the truth. she gets really upset and wants to take me home but my 
motorcycle was left in her garage and would not start so we had to go back to 
her house, while on the way he called her and wanted to talk to me, i began 
talking to him and asked him what he wanted to know as I was sick of the lies, 
he said everything so i said id start from the beginning, she then ripped the 
phone out of my hands and said to get out of her car. I told her she was 
unreasonable and to take me to her house to get my bike and we were yelling at 
each other. we got to her house and then I had emailed him telling him just a 
little about Rachael and I. she grabbed my phone again and ripped the battery 
out of it and grabbed the memory chip out of it and through it on the ground 
because she said there was evidence on there that I could send to john that 
would make him divorce her. I then told her that everything that was on the chip 
was also on my computer and to find the chip or else I will tell him everything, 
so she took it out of her pocket where she was hiding it from me. we walked the 
street by her house and she was talking to john lying to try to get out of what 
she has been hiding. My dad then came and we got my bike started and I left.
</font> </p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">Later that evening I Skype call John to come clean about 
things but right after I do, I get surprised by Rachael coming to my house 
really angry and shuts off Skype in a hurry and says she is going to destroy my 
computer and all the evidence she digs into my arm and wrestles me down to the 
floor</font></p>
<p align="center">
<font size="4">
<img border="0" src="pics/insertpics/digs.jpg" width="186" height="138"> </font> </p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">Rachael then Threatens me and says I better not contact or 
send John anything more or else She wont talk to me, then she realized I still 
might contact him and she threatened to call the cops on me to lie and say that 
I rapped her (which is the lowest thing a girl can ever do) she grabs a cup of 
water and tries to pour it on my computer but then I try stopping her and she 
just wips it all over me instead. I agree to not contact him again and she then 
leaves my house and we both are still really upset and don't talk for the next 
few days. I begin to think that maybe she is a normal cheater and then one night 
when I was drunk I remember she had told me her face book passwords. I know i 
shouldn't have checked anything but I did anyways because I was so fed up. While 
I was on her account I found pictures of several guys, and a
<a href="listofguys.htm">list of 15 guys she had Slept with</a>, one of which 
she just labeled &quot;That RIT guy&quot; because she did not even know his name. More 
Disturbing than that was the fact that Her old Bosses name (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1345879271&ref=ts">Brad Johnson</a>) was 
also on the list. I had known that something had went on with them because of 
how she would check his facebook page and the way she talked about him. </font> </p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">This all made me just sick and upset that she could be lying 
to me and John and herself really so I tried to keep myself busy but I still 
missed Rachael so much and missed here with me in my bed and doing everything 
together and it really hurt and I began to drink a lot to get over it. My friend 
Lonna was also over and we had parties where I would drink more. I began seeing 
a girl who used to be Rachael's friend, the same one who told me Rachael was 
interested in me the first day we met. we hung out for 3 or four days and she 
was nice but I didn't change the fact that I was still completely in love with 
Rachael. one night when I was at my house, Rachael called me and demanded to 
know who was at my house and if it was anyone she knew, and I didn't even tell 
her and I was still so pissed at her. about 20 minutes later she showed up at my 
house and I went outside to talk to her and she grabbed me and hugged me and 
told he she missed me so very much, as I missed her as well.. she said &quot;how 
could you do this to me? how could you see another girl?&quot; and I told her it was 
because she had been lying to everyone and that she hurt me so much. She then 
begged me to kick her out of my house and that she would spend the night with me 
like old times.. I really wanted to but I decided to be strong and tell her no.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">we both cried and it was so hard on both of us. Rachael then 
came over the day after and kissed me and we got over the big fight that we had. 
We began sleeping with each other again and doing everything with each other, 
That is where <a href="journal.htm">my Journal</a> began, It is only partial but 
has specific events and lies she kept telling john to make it look like she was 
not seeing me anymore, she even lied to her friends Maria and her family about 
our relationship, but every day we continued to see each other..&nbsp; We have 
been seeing each other almost every day since then. she tells me she has to 
choose between us and I beg that she does because I'm sick of the lies, which is 
why i'm also writing this, as a way for me to vent and figure out what's really 
going on with her. I gave her a week to decide and she still has not and its 
been almost two weeks, my friends tell me i'm crazy and I should just tell her 
husband everything but I really want it to be a decision she makes. I still an 
doing everything I can with her because I asked her if she wanted me to let her 
go and she said of course not, I love you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">She later told me &quot;Just keep being awesome and 
I know ill Pick you&quot;, I don't know what to believe anymore. recently I bought 
her and myself to see Skrillex at the water street music hall for 80 bucks a 
ticket where we the got tickets for Roots collider which she showed interest in, 
the next day was Wednesday and she was very busy so we did not chill and then 
she called and said that Thursday, July 7th she would be spending the night at 
my house.</font></p>
