This was the last confrontation i had with her husband, John Patton, in witch i 
was not going to contact except for the fact that when i woke up one morning 
with her while we were housesitting he sent me a photo of himself half nakid, i 
think he ment only to send it to Rachael but he replied to all from a bikini 
photo she had apparently sent to both of us the night before</span></span></p>

&gt; HA i got permission to break this awesome news to you nate ! seeing as how 
youre completely in love with my wife, you get the special honor of not being 
able to hang out with her or seeing her at all anymore !!! i never liked or 
trusted you from the start ... youre way too obvious about your intents with 
her. at first i was willing to over look that as long as u were respectable of 
her as a friend and a married woman, but last night u messed that all up buddy. 
begging her to send u pictures of her in a bikini is pretty far past the line, i 
figured you would know that but i guess not. do you not realize SHES MARRIED to 
ME not you, but to me. youre lucky she talked u up about being a good friend 
saying you would keep your distance not try anything last time i talked to her 
about you, but u kinda failed there so too bad so sad dont talk to my wife 
again. i gave you a chance cant say i didnt, this reflects on you so dont cry 
about it to me or her. i know youre going to try to send me something saying im 
a dick or i got it wrong and give me your side of what happened ... thats fine 
go for it, i trust rachael over you of course and your word means nothing to me 
now. if you give rachael any crap or upset her about anything youll be hearing 
from me again. just leave her be let her be happy, this marriage is hard enough 
right now without 'friends' like u trying to get with her. shell be gone within 
a month so keep your distance and everyones happy :) i appologize for coming off 
as a dick, im usually not i swear, but i have to make it clear shes my wife, she 
chose me, deal with it and move on, dont try to ruin that for me or for her, 
were perfect together, meant to be, etc etc, we have a great opportunity and 
will be completely happy and have an amazing time in europe as soon as she gets 
here. u should have been supporting her decision instead of trying to sabatage 
it when i wasnt there to do anything about it and i would never have had any 
problem with you at all. im not here forever so dont do anything youll regret.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
&gt; to recap, dont try hangin out with my wife anymore, im sure shell still talk 
to you, but dont be stupid ... dont be showing up at her house or any of that 
stalker crap cuz that would really ick me and her off. have a great life, meet a 
different beautiful girl to chase, good luck take care. btw shell be having this 
talk with you later also, just a heads up.<br>

And here is the big truth, im typing from my phone so I can't really go into 
total detail but.. it started with me and her on her birthday, we met because 
one of her friends told me she thought I was hot, then. Danced with her and then 
the next day I had to leave to go on a ship for work. During which rachael and I 
exchanged texts and calls and then I asked her out for valentines day and I got 
back on the 13th saw her the 14, 16, and she told me she was crazy about me as I 
was with her. Then I left again and she told me she made a big mistake and got 
engaged and she was gunna tell u everything and for me not to tell u anything. 
Then we hung out for the best 3 weeks of my life and then she gets married and 
was crying because she dident want to be and she would hold me and say &quot;mine&quot;. 
Im sorry for everything and im sorry she got me so in love with her<br>
